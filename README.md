This is a Python script that defines a class Nuclear to model nuclear isotopes and calculate energies associated with neutrons, protons, and alpha particles. 

This file contains a Python class that calculates various energy values for different isotopes, such as:

Binding energy per nucleon
Energy of neutrons
Energy of protons
Energy of alpha particles
This is useful for anyone working with nuclear physics simulations, especially in the context of nuclear energy calculations.
